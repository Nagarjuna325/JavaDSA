public boolean balanced() {
        return balanced(root);
    }

    private boolean balanced(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }
        return Math.abs(height(node.left) - height(node.right)) <= 1 && balanced(node.left) && balanced(node.right);
    } why we write like this becasue both are same methods right we can implement in one method only right

The reason for having two methods—balanced() and balanced(Node node)—is primarily for encapsulation and clarity. Let's break it down:

Why Two Methods?
Encapsulation of the Root Node Logic:

The balanced() method is the public method that the user of the class can call without needing to know the internal structure of the tree.
It starts the recursive check by calling the private helper method balanced(Node node) with the root of the tree.
Helper for Recursion:

The private balanced(Node node) method is designed to perform the actual recursion and logic for checking if the tree is balanced.
It takes a Node as a parameter, making it flexible to handle recursion on subtrees.
Why Not Combine Them?
If you combine them into a single method, you would need to expose the root node to the caller, which violates encapsulation. For example:

java
Copy code
public boolean balanced(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return Math.abs(height(node.left) - height(node.right)) <= 1 && balanced(node.left) && balanced(node.right);
}
This would require the caller to know about the Node class and pass the root explicitly:

java
Copy code
tree.balanced(tree.root); // Caller must know about the 'root'
This design is less clean and forces the user to understand the internal representation of the tree.

Advantages of Two Methods
Simplified API: The public method balanced() provides a clean and easy-to-use interface for users, hiding the internal details of how the tree is structured.

Encapsulation: The implementation details of the tree (like Node and root) remain private to the class. This adheres to the principle of information hiding in object-oriented programming.

Flexibility: By having a helper method, the recursive logic is isolated and reusable internally without exposing implementation details externally.

Final Thoughts
While technically

Let me explain this in a simpler way.

You are asking why there are two methods (balanced() and balanced(Node node)) instead of just one. Here's why:

1. Separation of Responsibility
The public method balanced() is the one that is meant to be used by people using your class. It doesn't require them to know anything about how your tree is built or how it works internally. It just says: "Is this tree balanced? Yes or No?"
The private method balanced(Node node) is a helper function that actually does the hard work. It performs the recursive checks to figure out if the tree is balanced or not.
If you combine both into one, then the caller might need to provide the root node themselves, like:

java
Copy code
tree.balanced(tree.root);
But that's inconvenient and forces the caller to know about the internal details of the tree (like what root is). Instead, with two methods, the caller simply does:

java
Copy code
tree.balanced();
This is cleaner and easier to understand.

2. Hiding the Internal Structure
By splitting the methods, you hide the internal details of your class. Users of your class don't need to know about your Node structure or even that there is a root node.

For example:

In the current design, the user calls tree.balanced() and doesn't care how the check is done.
If the Node structure or root ever changes inside your class, you can update the private method without affecting the public API.
This makes your code more maintainable.

3. Easier Recursion
The recursive logic requires a parameter (Node node) so it can check the left and right subtrees. However, when you start the process, you don't want the caller to pass the root node explicitly every time. The public balanced() method solves this by:

Starting the recursion from the root node.
Hiding the complexity of recursion from the caller.
Why Not Just One Method?
If you try to combine both, you lose these benefits:

You'd need to expose the Node structure and root, which breaks encapsulation.
The user has to know details about your tree's implementation, making your class harder to use.
In Short:
Two methods keep the class clean, simple to use, and well-structured.
The public balanced() method hides details and provides a user-friendly interface.
The private balanced(Node node) handles the complex recursion internally.
This is a common pattern in programming: a public "simple" method calls a private "complex" helper method.

how write in one give that one also

If you want to write the balanced() logic in one method, you can do it like this:

java
Copy code
public boolean balanced() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true; // An empty tree is balanced
    }
    return balancedHelper(root);
}

private boolean balancedHelper(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return Math.abs(height(node.left) - height(node.right)) <= 1
            && balancedHelper(node.left)
            && balancedHelper(node.right);
}
Explanation of this Implementation:
The public method balanced() directly checks if the tree is empty (base case).

If the root is null, it immediately returns true, because an empty tree is balanced.
Otherwise, it starts the recursion by calling the helper balancedHelper(node) on the root node.
The private method balancedHelper(Node node) contains the recursive logic to check if a subtree is balanced:

It calculates the difference in height for the left and right subtrees.
It recursively checks if the left and right subtrees are balanced.
Why This Still Uses a Helper
Even in this design, you need a helper function for recursion because the public method does not take a Node parameter. You cannot handle the recursive logic directly in the public method unless you expose the tree's structure to the caller, which is usually not desirable.

If You Really Want One Method:
To make it strictly one method (not recommended due to encapsulation issues), you would have to expose the Node structure and pass the root node explicitly:

java
Copy code
public boolean balanced(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return Math.abs(height(node.left) - height(node.right)) <= 1
            && balanced(node.left)
            && balanced(node.right);
}
Then the caller would have to call it like this:

java
Copy code
tree.balanced(tree.root);
Why This Is Not Ideal:
It exposes internal details (like Node and root) to the outside world.
It makes the API harder to use since the caller needs to know about the tree's internal structure.
Preferred Approach:
Use the first implementation, where:

balanced() is a clean public method.
balancedHelper(Node node) is a private helper that handles recursion.

why we need to call like this  tree.balanced( root); and just enter valueright in it
ChatGPT said:

You’re asking why we can't just directly call the balanced() method with a single value or start checking directly. The short answer is that the method needs to know where to start checking the balance, which in this case is the root node of the tree. Let’s break this down step by step:

1. Why tree.balanced(root)?
The balanced() method checks if a tree (or a part of the tree) is balanced. To do this:

It needs to know the starting point (usually the root of the tree).
Trees are typically implemented as a collection of nodes connected in a parent-child hierarchy. The root is the topmost node that acts as the entry point for traversing the tree.
If you don’t tell the method which node to start checking from (like the root), the method won’t know where to begin.

2. Can’t We Just Pass a Value Instead of root?
Passing a single value (e.g., a number like 5) wouldn’t work because:

The tree’s structure depends on its nodes, not just the values stored in them.
The method needs access to the left and right children of each node to check their heights and recursively determine if the subtrees are balanced.
For example:

java
Copy code
public boolean balanced(int value) {
    // What does this value mean?
    // A tree can't be checked with a single number because balance depends on structure.
}
Here, a single number (value) doesn’t provide information about the entire tree structure.

3. Why Not Just Start with root Automatically?
That’s exactly what a properly designed API does! For convenience, we usually have a public method like balanced() that automatically starts at the root node without requiring the caller to pass it explicitly. For example:

java
Copy code
public boolean balanced() {
    return balancedHelper(root);
}
This hides the internal detail (the root) and lets the user call it like:

java
Copy code
tree.balanced();
4. Why Use tree.balanced(root) at All?
If you call tree.balanced(root), it’s because:

You might want to check balance starting from a specific part of the tree (not necessarily the whole tree starting from root).
However, this is rare for general-purpose APIs because users usually care about the whole tree's balance, not just a subtree.
In most cases, the public method without arguments (tree.balanced()) is preferred, and the starting point (root) is handled internally.

Conclusion:
You can't just pass a single value (like a number) because balancing depends on the tree structure, not just the values. The method needs a reference to a node (root) to:

Start the recursive check.
Access left and right children of nodes during the process.
To simplify usage:

A public method without parameters (balanced()) is provided, which internally starts the process from the root.
This hides the complexity from the user while keeping the logic clean and encapsulated.
