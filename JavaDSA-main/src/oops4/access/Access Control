Q1. Time stamp - 20:00 to 30:00 IMPORTANT VERY.

Q2. public class Singleton  extends A we know in java every class also inherits objects class right then how does now the Singleton class is inheriting 2 classes A , and Object class as we know multiple inheritance is not allowed in java

Great question! Let's break it down.

Understanding Inheritance in Java
In Java, every class implicitly extends Object unless it explicitly extends another class.

java
Copy
Edit
class A {
    // Class A code
}

public class Singleton extends A {
    // Singleton inherits from A
}
Here‚Äôs what happens under the hood:

Singleton explicitly extends A.
A implicitly extends Object (if not extending another class).
Inheritance chain:
Singleton ‚Üí A ‚Üí Object
Why Isn't This Multiple Inheritance?
Java allows only single inheritance of classes (i.e., a class can extend only one class).
But inheritance is transitive:
Singleton extends A.
A extends Object.
Singleton indirectly inherits Object via A, not directly.
Since each class still extends only one parent class at a time, it is not multiple inheritance.
Multiple Inheritance vs. Java's Approach
Multiple Inheritance (Not Allowed in Java):
java
Copy
Edit
class A {}
class B {}

// ‚ùå This would cause ambiguity (not allowed in Java)
public class Singleton extends A, B { }
Java allows single inheritance with an inheritance chain:
java
Copy
Edit
class A extends Object {}  // Implicitly extends Object
class Singleton extends A {}  // Inherits Object via A
Key Takeaways
Every class in Java ultimately extends Object (directly or indirectly).
A class can extend only one class (single inheritance), but it can still inherit from Object indirectly.
No multiple inheritance of classes, but multiple inheritance of behavior is possible via interfaces.
Let me know if you want further clarification! üöÄ
