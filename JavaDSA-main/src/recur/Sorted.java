        // statment will be going to false so it does not evaluate next sort it return it thats it.

        // and one more point is the ref of arr is changing at every step but the value of the object is same
        // which it is pointing is same pass by ref value only not by pass by ref,

//this is my code for checking sorted or not using recrusion can u explain me as each recrusion call it stores in stack right does it stores the arr , index3 means the array values will be from index 3 to last will be in array is it right or all the array elements will be in stack can u explain to me
//Sure, let's break down your code and understand how recursion works in this context, especially focusing on how the array and index are handled in each recursive call.
//
//Code Explanation
//Your code is designed to check if an array is sorted in ascending order using recursion. Here's a brief overview of how it works:
//
//Main Method:
//
//You initialize an array arr with some integers.
//
//You call the sorted method with the array and the starting index 0.
//
//Sorted Method:
//
//This method checks if the array is sorted from the given index to the end.
//
//The base condition is when index reaches the last element of the array (arr.length - 1). If this happens, it returns true because a single element is always considered sorted.
//
//The recursive case checks if the current element (arr[index]) is less than the next element (arr[index + 1]). If this condition holds, it makes a recursive call with the next index (index + 1).
//
//Recursion and the Call Stack
//When you call a method recursively, each call is added to the call stack. The call stack keeps track of the state of each method call, including the parameters and local variables.
//
//How the Array and Index are Handled
//Array (arr): The array itself is not copied or modified during the recursive calls. Instead, a reference to the same array is passed in each recursive call. This means that all recursive calls operate on the same array in memory. The array is not stored multiple times in the stack; only the reference to the array is passed.
//
//Index (index): The index is a local variable in each recursive call. Each call to sorted has its own copy of the index variable, which is incremented by 1 in each recursive call. These index values are stored in the call stack.
//
//        Example Walkthrough
//Let's walk through the recursive calls with your example array {1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 8}:
//
//First Call: sorted(arr, 0)
//
//Checks if arr[0] < arr[1] â†’ 1 < 2 â†’ true
//
//Makes a recursive call: sorted(arr, 1)
//
//Second Call: sorted(arr, 1)
//
//Checks if arr[1] < arr[2] â†’ 2 < 3 â†’ true
//
//Makes a recursive call: sorted(arr, 2)
//
//Third Call: sorted(arr, 2)
//
//Checks if arr[2] < arr[3] â†’ 3 < 5 â†’ true
//
//Makes a recursive call: sorted(arr, 3)
//
//Fourth Call: sorted(arr, 3)
//
//Checks if arr[3] < arr[4] â†’ 5 < 16 â†’ true
//
//Makes a recursive call: sorted(arr, 4)
//
//Fifth Call: sorted(arr, 4)
//
//Checks if arr[4] < arr[5] â†’ 16 < 8 â†’ false
//
//Returns false
//
//Unwinding the Stack:
//
//The false value propagates back up the call stack, and the final result of sorted(arr, 0) is false.
//
//Summary
//The array is not stored multiple times in the stack; only the reference to the array is passed.
//
//Each recursive call has its own copy of the index variable, which is stored in the call stack.
//
//The recursion continues until the base condition is met or an out-of-order pair is found.
//
//I hope this clarifies how the recursion and the call stack work in your code!
//
//so that means we it first checks whether the condition in left side holds true or not then only it will call the right recrusive right, how it is just a comparsion right, that means every statement is a recrusive call itslef I means check has it as a return is it
//Yes, you're absolutely correct! Let's break this down step by step to understand how the condition and recursive call work in your code.
//
//Key Point: Short-Circuit Evaluation
//        In Java, the logical AND operator (&&) uses short-circuit evaluation. This means that if the left-hand side of the && is false, the right-hand side is not evaluated because the overall result is already determined to be false.
//
//In your code:
//
//java
//        Copy
//return arr[index] < arr[index + 1] && sorted(arr, index + 1);
//Hereâ€™s what happens:
//
//Left Side (arr[index] < arr[index + 1]):
//
//This is a comparison that checks if the current element is less than the next element in the array.
//
//If this comparison evaluates to false, the entire expression (arr[index] < arr[index + 1] && sorted(arr, index + 1)) will immediately return false without evaluating the right side (the recursive call).
//
//Right Side (sorted(arr, index + 1)):
//
//This is the recursive call that checks the rest of the array.
//
//It is only evaluated if the left side is true.
//
//How It Works Step by Step
//Letâ€™s revisit your example array {1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 8} and see how this plays out:
//
//First Call: sorted(arr, 0)
//
//Left Side: arr[0] < arr[1] â†’ 1 < 2 â†’ true
//
//Since the left side is true, the right side (sorted(arr, 1)) is evaluated.
//
//Second Call: sorted(arr, 1)
//
//Left Side: arr[1] < arr[2] â†’ 2 < 3 â†’ true
//
//Since the left side is true, the right side (sorted(arr, 2)) is evaluated.
//
//Third Call: sorted(arr, 2)
//
//Left Side: arr[2] < arr[3] â†’ 3 < 5 â†’ true
//
//Since the left side is true, the right side (sorted(arr, 3)) is evaluated.
//
//Fourth Call: sorted(arr, 3)
//
//Left Side: arr[3] < arr[4] â†’ 5 < 16 â†’ true
//
//Since the left side is true, the right side (sorted(arr, 4)) is evaluated.
//
//Fifth Call: sorted(arr, 4)
//
//Left Side: arr[4] < arr[5] â†’ 16 < 8 â†’ false
//
//Since the left side is false, the right side (sorted(arr, 5)) is not evaluated.
//
//The method immediately returns false.
//
//Unwinding the Stack:
//
//The false result propagates back up the call stack, and the final result of sorted(arr, 0) is false.
//
//Why This Matters
//Efficiency: Short-circuit evaluation ensures that the recursion stops as soon as an out-of-order pair is found. This avoids unnecessary recursive calls and makes the algorithm more efficient.
//
//Logical Flow: The left side (arr[index] < arr[index + 1]) acts as a guard condition. If it fails, the recursion stops immediately.
//
//Is Every Statement a Recursive Call?
//No, not every statement is a recursive call. In your code:
//
//java
//        Copy
//return arr[index] < arr[index + 1] && sorted(arr, index + 1);
//arr[index] < arr[index + 1] is a comparison, not a recursive call.
//
//sorted(arr, index + 1) is the recursive call, but it is only executed if the comparison (arr[index] < arr[index + 1]) is true.
//
//Summary
//The left side (arr[index] < arr[index + 1]) is evaluated first.
//
//If the left side is false, the recursion stops immediately, and false is returned.
//
//If the left side is true, the recursive call (sorted(arr, index + 1)) is evaluated.
//
//This ensures that the recursion only continues as long as the array is sorted up to the current index.
//
//I hope this clarifies how the condition and recursion work together in your code! Let me know if you have further questions. ðŸ˜Š
//
//does all the other languages follows same logical AND or not
//Great question! The behavior of the logical AND (&&) operator can vary slightly across programming languages, especially in terms of short-circuit evaluation. Letâ€™s break it down:
//
//Short-Circuit Evaluation in Logical AND (&&)
//Most modern programming languages implement short-circuit evaluation for the logical AND (&&) operator. This means:
//
//If the left-hand side of the && is false, the right-hand side is not evaluated because the result is already determined to be false.
//
//This behavior is common in many languages, but there are exceptions. Letâ€™s look at how different languages handle this:
//
//Languages That Follow Short-Circuit Evaluation for &&
//These languages behave similarly to Java:
//
//Java:
//
//        && uses short-circuit evaluation.
//
//Example:
//
//java
//        Copy
//if (false && someFunction()) {
//        // someFunction() is never called
//        }
//C/C++:
//
//        && uses short-circuit evaluation.
//
//Example:
//
//c
//        Copy
//if (0 && printf("This won't print")) {
//        // printf() is never called
//        }
//Python:
//
//and uses short-circuit evaluation.
//
//Example:
//
//python
//        Copy
//if False and some_function():
//        # some_function() is never called
//JavaScript:
//
//        && uses short-circuit evaluation.
//
//Example:
//
//javascript
//        Copy
//if (false && someFunction()) {
//        // someFunction() is never called
//        }
//C#:
//
//        && uses short-circuit evaluation.
//
//Example:
//
//csharp
//        Copy
//if (false && SomeMethod()) {
//        // SomeMethod() is never called
//        }
//Ruby:
//
//        && uses short-circuit evaluation.
//
//Example:
//
//ruby
//        Copy
//if false && some_method
//    # some_method is never called
//end
//Languages That Do NOT Follow Short-Circuit Evaluation for Logical AND
//Some languages do not use short-circuit evaluation for their logical AND operator. Instead, they evaluate both sides of the expression regardless of the result of the left-hand side. These languages typically have a non-short-circuiting AND operator.
//
//        SQL:
//
//SQL does not guarantee short-circuit evaluation for AND.
//
//        Example:
//
//sql
//        Copy
//WHERE FALSE AND some_function()
//-- some_function() might still be evaluated
//VB.NET:
//
//The And operator does not use short-circuit evaluation.
//
//If you want short-circuiting, you must use AndAlso.
//
//Example:
//
//vb.net
//        Copy
//If False And SomeFunction() Then
//    ' SomeFunction() is still called
//End If
//Pascal:
//
//The and operator does not use short-circuit evaluation.
//
//Example:
//
//pascal
//        Copy
//if False and SomeFunction() then
//// SomeFunction() is still called
//R:
//
//The & operator does not use short-circuit evaluation.
//
//If you want short-circuiting, you must use &&.
//
//Example:
//
//R
//        Copy
//if (FALSE & some_function()) {
//        # some_function() is still called
//}
//Key Takeaways
//Most Languages Use Short-Circuit Evaluation:
//
//Languages like Java, C/C++, Python, JavaScript, C#, and Ruby use short-circuit evaluation for their logical AND operator (&& or and).
//
//Some Languages Have Non-Short-Circuiting AND:
//
//Languages like SQL, VB.NET, Pascal, and R have a non-short-circuiting AND operator. In these languages, both sides of the expression are evaluated regardless of the result of the left-hand side.
//
//Check the Language Documentation:
//
//If you're unsure about a specific language, always check its documentation to confirm whether its logical AND operator uses short-circuit evaluation.
//
//Example in Python (Short-Circuiting)
//python
//        Copy
//def some_function():
//print("This won't print")
//    return True
//
//if False and some_function():
//print("This won't execute")
//Output:
//
//Copy
//        (Nothing is printed because `some_function()` is never called)
//Example in VB.NET (Non-Short-Circuiting)
//vb.net
//        Copy
//Function SomeFunction() As Boolean
//    Console.WriteLine("This will print")
//Return True
//End Function
//
//If False And SomeFunction() Then
//    Console.WriteLine("This won't execute")
//End If
//Output:
//
//Copy
//This will print
//        Conclusion
//Most modern programming languages follow short-circuit evaluation for the logical AND operator (&& or and), but there are exceptions. Always check the behavior of the specific language you're working with to avoid unexpected results! Let me know if you'd like further clarification. ðŸ˜Š
