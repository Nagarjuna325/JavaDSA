// encapsulation - is solving the implementation level issue - wrapping the implemetation of data members and methods in a class.
// Abstraction - is solving the design level issue.- internal one
// abstraction is a process of gaining information , encapsulation is a process of containing information.
// Hiding unnesacay details and showing valuable information.
// example println , Arraylist, get , set ... all this types

// when someone asks u what is abstraction and encapsulation?
// abstraction is solving the design level issue , and encapsulation is solving the implementation level issue (we the engineer
// who are using to solve some problems.

// abstraction focus on external working , encapsulation is working with internal issue.
// abstraction is the way of gaining information , encapsulation is the way of containing information.

// also see when we declared the variable as private and getting that value in other class via the get method we created in the class
// where we declared it as private , so it is simply called as encapsulation. - TIMESTAMP - 2:07:10
// IN ENCAPSULATION we use getters and setters , and in abstraction we use interface and abstract classes.

// what is the difference between data hiding and encapsulation?
