System.out.println(in.next());   we know we need the object to call a method that means a reference variable right obj.method() like this then why does we  cannot just use out.println here why we need className.objectname.methodname
Why System.out.println() is Used Instead of Just out.println()?

In Java, System.out.println() is a common way to print output to the console. To understand why we can't just use out.println(), let's break down the components:

1. Breakdown of System.out.println()
System ‚Üí A class in java.lang package.

out ‚Üí A static PrintStream object inside System.

println() ‚Üí A method of the PrintStream class.

2. Why out.println() Doesn't Work Alone?
out is not a standalone object in your code. It is a static member of the System class.

Since out is not a global variable, you must specify where it comes from (System.out).

Java enforces explicit scoping (unlike some languages like Python where print() works directly).

3. Analogy
Think of System as a "bank", out as an ATM inside the bank, and println() as a function of the ATM.

You can't just say ATM.withdraw()‚Äîyou must specify which bank's ATM (Bank.ATM.withdraw()).

4. Why System.out is Static?
out is declared as:

java
public static final PrintStream out;
It is shared across all Java programs, so it‚Äôs not instantiated per object.

Since it‚Äôs static, you access it via System.out (not an instance).

5. Example: Correct vs Incorrect Usage
‚úÖ Correct (Full path):

java
System.out.println("Hello");
‚ùå Incorrect (Missing System):

java
out.println("Hello"); // Error: 'out' cannot be resolved
6. Can We Shorten It?
Yes! You can statically import System.out (but it‚Äôs not recommended for readability):

java
import static java.lang.System.out;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        out.println("Hello"); // Now works!
    }
}
But this is discouraged because:

It reduces code clarity (where did out come from?).

Can cause conflicts if multiple static imports define out.

7. Key Takeaways
System.out.println() is used because out is a static member of System.

Java requires explicit class qualification for static members.

Shortcuts like out.println() are possible but not recommended for maintainability.

Final Answer
You must use System.out.println() because:

out is a static PrintStream object inside System.

Java does not allow standalone use of out (unlike global functions in some languages).

Explicit scoping (ClassName.member) is enforced for clarity and correctness.
