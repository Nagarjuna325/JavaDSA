String a = "kunal"

String b = "Kunal"

So does it stores seperately in the heap memory or how it is stored? - Time Stamp 10:00

 it will create a single value in the memory and points to the same value in the memory

 there is a String pool in the memory which is a seperate part in the memory?

 So now the question can we change the values now
   like b = "arjun" what will happen?
    will it change or not?
     Answer NO,  why does it not change it are immutable.

     diagram 14:00 is important


// Time Stamp - 29:00 - Very Important

System.out.println();

right in that "out" is an variable of "PrintStream" class

See and observe carefully what is class a datatype so we have a datatype of variable of "out"
