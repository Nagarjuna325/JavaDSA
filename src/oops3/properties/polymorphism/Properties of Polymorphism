  Parent obj = new Child();

  here which method will be called depends on Object() type defines(Child()) - means which method to execute or run.
  This is known as upcasting - This is how overriding works.

  But how does JAVA determines this? - BY using "dynamic method dispatch".- it is a mechanism which decides which method to run in case of overriden method, at run-time.
  But the main point here is if that method is not in the parent class then it will give us an error, even-though it is accessing
  it from the child class, we need to have that method in the parent class, which is overriden in child class.
