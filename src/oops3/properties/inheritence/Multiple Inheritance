if one class extends more than one class is class multiple inheritance.

what is multiple inheritance in java and why does java does not support it and pythons supports and how does it works and what causes it to not work in java explain in simple short and easy way to understand

Multiple Inheritance in Java:

Multiple inheritance is when a class can inherit from more than one class. Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes directly to avoid confusion and ambiguity in the code.
Why Java does not support it:

Diamond Problem: This occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a method with the same signature. If both parent classes define the same method, the child class will have a conflict about which method to inherit.
Java avoids this problem by allowing single inheritance and uses interfaces to achieve a form of multiple inheritance.
Why Python supports it:

Python allows multiple inheritance and resolves ambiguity using a method called Method Resolution Order (MRO). Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to decide the method's resolution in case of conflicts, ensuring there's no ambiguity.
How it works in Python:

In Python, a class can inherit from multiple classes, and the interpreter will follow the MRO to decide which method to call when there's an overlap.
Summary:

Java avoids multiple inheritance to prevent conflicts like the diamond problem.
Python supports it and handles ambiguity using MRO.

can u explain with code examples for both in simple and easy and short way

Sure! Here's a simple code example for both Java and Python to explain multiple inheritance:

Java (Does not support multiple inheritance for classes)
In Java, if you try to directly inherit from multiple classes, it will give a compilation error.

// Java Example: Multiple Inheritance is NOT supported for classes

class A {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Class A");
    }
}

class B {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Class B");
    }
}

// This will give a compilation error because Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes
class C extends A, B {
    // Error: Class C cannot have multiple parents
}
How Java handles it:
Instead of using multiple inheritance, Java uses interfaces to achieve a similar result.

java
Copy
Edit
interface A {
    void displayA();
}

interface B {
    void displayB();
}

class C implements A, B {
    public void displayA() {
        System.out.println("Class A");
    }

    public void displayB() {
        System.out.println("Class B");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C obj = new C();
        obj.displayA();
        obj.displayB();
    }
}
Python (Supports multiple inheritance)
Python supports multiple inheritance, and it will follow the Method Resolution Order (MRO) if there is a conflict.

# Python Example: Multiple Inheritance is supported

class A:
    def display(self):
        print("Class A")

class B:
    def display(self):
        print("Class B")

# Class C inherits from both A and B
class C(A, B):
    pass

# Now, if we create an instance of C and call display()
obj = C()
obj.display()  # This will call display() from class A (the first parent in the MRO)
Output:

Class A
How Python handles it:

Python uses the MRO (Method Resolution Order) to determine which method to call in case of a conflict. In this example, since A is the first parent class listed, display() from A is called.
I hope this makes it clearer!
