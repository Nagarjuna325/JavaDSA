1. Single inheritance: one class extends other class

2. Multi-level inheritance: subclass can be a parent class of other sub-class(child)

   Box -> Box Weight -> Box Price

3. Multiple Inheritance - timestamp - 1:01:10

   One class extends more than one class

   class C extends A , B {
   }

   if class A and class B has same properties like x = 10 , x = 5 in class B
   the class C will have a ambiguity which one to pick.

   So thats why not allowed in Java.

   by using interface we can achieve multiple inheritance.(using abstract class)

4. Hierachical inheritance - One clas is extended by many class

 class A{}
 class B extends A{}
 class C extends A{}

5. Hybrid Inheritance: Multiple inheritance + Single inheritance
  NOT in Java .
