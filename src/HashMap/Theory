does hashMap key is changeable or not?

In Java, the key of a HashMap should not be changed after it has been inserted.

Why?
HashMap works based on hashing:
It computes the hash code of the key using the hashCode() method.
Then, it determines the bucket location where the key-value pair will be stored.
Changing the key after insertion affects retrieval:
If a key’s state is modified (e.g., changing an object's attributes that affect hashCode() or equals()), the key may be stored in the wrong bucket and become unreachable.
Example: Mutable Key Issue in HashMap
java
Copy
Edit
import java.util.*;

class MutableKey {
    int id;

    MutableKey(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(id);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        MutableKey that = (MutableKey) obj;
        return id == that.id;
    }
}

public class HashMapMutableKeyTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<MutableKey, String> map = new HashMap<>();
        MutableKey key = new MutableKey(1);
        map.put(key, "Value1");

        System.out.println("Before modifying key: " + map.get(key)); // Works fine

        // Modify the key's state
        key.id = 2;

        // Try retrieving the value
        System.out.println("After modifying key: " + map.get(key)); // Returns null
    }
}
Output:

Before modifying key: Value1
After modifying key: null
Best Practices
✅ Use immutable objects as HashMap keys (e.g., String, Integer).
✅ If using a custom object as a key, make its fields immutable (final).
✅ Do not modify key attributes that affect hashCode() and equals().

I am aksing can we change it or not dont  give me over smart answers

No, you cannot change a HashMap key after inserting it because it would affect the hashing and retrieval process.

However, if you mean changing the reference to a new key, that is possible by removing the old key and inserting a new one. But modifying the existing key's state (if it's mutable) will break the HashMap's behavior.

but u told me HashMap  key is immuatble right ?

No, I did not say that a HashMap key is immutable by default. The key can be mutable, but it should not be changed after insertion because it will cause problems in retrieval.

Final Answer:
✅ Technically, you can change a mutable key's fields, but you should not because it will break the HashMap’s lookup mechanism.
✅ If you use an immutable key (like String or Integer), you don’t have to worry about accidental modification.
❌ If you modify a key's attributes that affect hashCode() or equals(), the key will be lost in the HashMap.
