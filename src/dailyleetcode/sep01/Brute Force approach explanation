So continue means it will skip the next lines of code and increase the i value right and checks right and what about break explain to me with a simple example also
We are using three nested loops to generate all possible splits of the string into four segments.?

 The condition `if (!isValid(first)) continue;` means that if the first segment is not valid, we skip the rest of the code inside the outer loop for the current `i` and move to the next `i`.
 Similarly, for the inner loops, we use `continue` to skip the current iteration if the segment is invalid.
 Let me explain `continue` and `break` with a simple example:
 - `continue`: It skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration.
 - `break`: It exits the current loop entirely.
 In our code, we use `continue` to skip the current segment if it is invalid, meaning we don't proceed to check the next segments for the current split.
 Example of `continue` in a loop:
 for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
   if (i == 2) {
     continue;
   }
   System.out.println(i);
 }
 This will print: 0, 1, 3, 4 (skips 2).
 Example of `break` in a loop:
 for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
   if (i == 2) {
     break;
   }
   System.out.println(i);
 }
 This will print: 0, 1 (exits the loop when i is 2).
 In our code, we also have conditions like `if (j > n) break;` in the inner loops. This is to prevent the inner loops from running when the index `j` exceeds the string length, which would cause an error when trying to take a substring.
 Now, let's walk through the code with a small example.
 Example: s = "25525511135"
 Outer loop: i from 1 to 3
   i=1: first = "2" -> valid -> proceed to inner loop for j
     j from i+1 (2) to i+3 (4) but also j<=n (11)
     j=2: second = s.substring(1,2) = "5" -> valid -> proceed to inner loop for k
       k from j+1 (3) to j+3 (5) and k<=11
       k=3: third = s.substring(2,3) = "5" -> valid -> fourth = s.substring(3) = "25511135" -> check valid: too long (8 digits) -> invalid
       k=4: third = s.substring(2,4) = "52" -> valid -> fourth = s.substring(4) = "5511135" -> invalid (7 digits)
       k=5: third = s.substring(2,5) = "525" -> valid? 525 is between 0 and 255 -> valid -> fourth = s.substring(5) = "511135" -> invalid (6 digits)
     j=3: second = s.substring(1,3) = "55" -> valid -> then k from 4 to 6
       k=4: third = s.substring(3,4) = "2" -> valid -> fourth = s.substring(4) = "5511135" -> invalid
       k=5: third = s.substring(3,5) = "25" -> valid -> fourth = s.substring(5) = "511135" -> invalid
       k=6: third = s.substring(3,6) = "255" -> valid -> fourth = s.substring(6) = "11135" -> invalid (5 digits)
     j=4: second = s.substring(1,4) = "552" -> 552 is greater than 255 -> invalid -> skip (continue)
   i=2: first = "25" -> valid -> proceed
     j from 3 to 5
     j=3: second = s.substring(2,3) = "5" -> valid -> k from 4 to 6
       k=4: third = s.substring(3,4) = "2" -> valid -> fourth = "5511135" -> invalid
       k=5: third = s.substring(3,5) = "25" -> valid -> fourth = "511135" -> invalid
       k=6: third = s.substring(3,6) = "255" -> valid -> fourth = "11135" -> invalid
     j=4: second = s.substring(2,4) = "52" -> valid -> k from 5 to 7
       k=5: third = s.substring(4,5) = "5" -> valid -> fourth = "11135" -> invalid
       k=6: third = s.substring(4,6) = "51" -> valid -> fourth = "1135" -> invalid (4 digits, but 1135 is 1135 which is >255 -> invalid)
       k=7: third = s.substring(4,7) = "511" -> 511>255 -> invalid -> skip
     j=5: second = s.substring(2,5) = "525" -> 525>255 -> invalid -> skip
   i=3: first = "255" -> valid -> proceed
     j from 4 to 6
     j=4: second = s.substring(3,4) = "2" -> valid -> k from 5 to 7
       k=5: third = s.substring(4,5) = "5" -> valid -> fourth = "11135" -> invalid
       k=6: third = s.substring(4,6) = "51" -> valid -> fourth = "1135" -> invalid (1135>255)
       k=7: third = s.substring(4,7) = "511" -> 511>255 -> invalid
     j=5: second = s.substring(3,5) = "25" -> valid -> k from 6 to 8
       k=6: third = s.substring(5,6) = "5" -> valid -> fourth = "1135" -> invalid
       k=7: third = s.substring(5,7) = "11" -> valid -> fourth = "135" -> valid (135<=255) -> so we have "255.25.11.135" -> but wait, let's check the actual string:
            first: 255, second: 25 (from index3 to5 -> actually the string is "25525", so second is "25" but note the original string is "25525511135", so:
            first: indices0-2: "255"
            second: indices3-4: "25" -> but wait, that's correct? Actually, we are taking substring(3,5) which is the characters at index3 and 4 -> which is "25" (from the next part of the string)
            third: indices5-6: "11" -> valid
            fourth: indices7-10: "135" -> but wait, the string length is 11, so indices7 to 10 is 4 characters? Actually, we are taking from index7 to the end -> "11135" from index7? Let me recalculate:
            Actually, the string is "25525511135"
            i=3: first = "255"
            j=5: second = s.substring(3,5) = "25" -> valid
            k=7: third = s.substring(5,7) = "51" -> wait, no: the substring(5,7) would be the characters at index5 and 6 -> which are '5' and '1' -> so "51" -> but wait, that is not correct because the string after first and second is:
            The original string: indices 0-2: 255, indices 3-4: 25, then indices 5-6: we are taking for third -> but the next two characters are actually "51" from the string? But the string at index5 is the fifth character:
            Let's index the string:
            index0:2, 1:5, 2:5, 3:2, 4:5, 5:5, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:3, 10:5
            So for i=3, j=5:
                first: indices0-2 -> "255"
                second: indices3-4 -> "25"
                then k=7: third: indices5-6 -> "55" ? Wait, no: j=5, so we are taking from index5 to 6 -> that's two characters: index5 is '5' and index6 is '1' -> so "51"?
            But wait, the string from index5 is actually the fifth character: which is the first '5' of the next part? Actually, the string is "25525511135", so:
            Let me write the indices with characters:
            0:2, 1:5, 2:5, 3:2, 4:5, 5:5, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:3, 10:5
            So for j=5, we are taking second = substring(3,5) -> indices3 and 4: which are '2' and '5' -> so "25"
            Then for k=7, third = substring(5,7) -> indices5 and 6: which are '5' and '1' -> "51"
            Then fourth = substring(7) -> from index7 to the end: '1','1','1','3','5' -> "11135" -> which is 5 digits and 11135>255 -> invalid.
            So we need to continue until we find the valid splits.
 Actually, the valid splits for "25525511135" are:
   "255.255.11.135" and "255.255.111.35"
 So let's find how we get "255.255.11.135":
   first: 3 characters: "255" -> valid (i=3)
   second: then j should be i+1=4, but we need to take 3 characters for second? So j should be 3+3=6 -> so j=6: second = substring(3,6) = "255" -> valid
   then third: k from j+1=7 to j+3=9. We need to take 2 characters for third: so k=7+2=9? Actually, third should be from index6 to index7? Wait, note:
        first: indices0-2 -> "255"
        second: indices3-5 -> "255" (because substring(3,6) gives indices3,4,5 -> which are '2','5','5' -> "255")
        third: then we need to take two characters: indices6-7 -> "11"
        so k=8: because substring(6,8) gives indices6 and 7 -> "11"
        fourth: indices8-10 -> "135" -> which is valid.
   So for i=3, j=6, k=8.
   Now, check the code:
        i=3: first valid.
        j=6: second = substring(3,6) = "255" -> valid.
        k=8: third = substring(6,8) = "11" -> valid.
        fourth = substring(8) = "135" -> valid.
   So we add "255.255.11.135"
 Similarly, for "255.255.111.35":
        i=3, j=6, k=9:
            third = substring(6,9) = "111" -> valid
            fourth = substring(9) = "35" -> valid.
   So we add "255.255.111.35"
 So the code will generate these two.
 Now, back to the condition: `if (!isValid(first)) continue;`
   For i=3, first is "255" -> valid -> so we don't skip, we proceed to the inner loops.
 The condition `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop if the segment is invalid, and move to the next value of the loop variable.
 The condition `break` in the inner loops (like `if (j > n) break;`) is to prevent the loop from running beyond the string length. For example, if the string length is 5, then when j becomes 6, we break out of the inner loop for j because we cannot have a segment starting beyond the string.
 I hope this clarifies.
Explanation of Continue and Break in Loops
Let me explain the difference between continue and break with simple examples, then show how they work in your IP address code.

Simple Examples
Continue Statement
java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue; // Skip the rest of this iteration
    }
    System.out.println("Number: " + i);
}
Output:

text
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 4
Number: 5
The continue statement skips the current iteration when i equals 3, but the loop continues with the next value.

Break Statement
java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break; // Exit the loop entirely
    }
    System.out.println("Number: " + i);
}
Output:

text
Number: 1
Number: 2
The break statement completely exits the loop when i equals 3.

In Your IP Address Code
Let's look at your specific code:

java
if (!isValid(first)) continue;
This means:

If the first segment is NOT valid (!isValid(first) returns true)

Then continue to the next iteration of the outer loop (skip trying different j and k values for this invalid first segment)

This saves time by avoiding unnecessary processing

The checks like if (j > n) break; are safety measures to prevent trying to access parts of the string that don't exist.
