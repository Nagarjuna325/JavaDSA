for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--) {
            output[count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10] - 1] = arr[i];
            count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10]--;
        } tell me at first time this runs at first how it got 8 in the place of output array

Let's break down the first iteration of this loop in countSort1 for better understanding.

Understanding the Line:
java
Copy
Edit
output[count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10] - 1] = arr[i];
count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10]--;
We are placing elements into the output array based on their digit position (from count array).
We are iterating from right to left (i = n - 1 to 0) to maintain stable sorting.
Example Input:
Given Array:
java
Copy
Edit
arr = {29, 83, 471, 36, 91, 8}
Assume First Pass (exp = 1) (Sorting by 1s place)
Compute digit at 1s place for each number:
Copy
Edit
29  â†’ 9
83  â†’ 3
471 â†’ 1
36  â†’ 6
91  â†’ 1
8   â†’ 8
Step 1: Construct the count Array
We first count occurrences:

less
Copy
Edit
Count of 1s place digits: [0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
Step 2: Modify count for Positioning
Cumulative sum of count:

less
Copy
Edit
Count (updated positions): [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
This means:

Numbers with 1s digit = 1 go to index 1 (since there are two 1s)
Numbers with 1s digit = 3 go to index 2
Numbers with 1s digit = 6 go to index 3
Numbers with 1s digit = 8 go to index 4
Numbers with 1s digit = 9 go to index 5
Step 3: Construct the Output Array (Iterating Right to Left)
First Iteration (i = n-1 = 5 â†’ arr[5] = 8)
java
Copy
Edit
output[count[(arr[5] / 1) % 10] - 1] = arr[5];
count[(arr[5] / 1) % 10]--;
Extract digit: (arr[5] / 1) % 10 = (8 / 1) % 10 = 8
Find position from count: count[8] - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4
Place 8 in output[4]
Update count[8]: count[8]-- (decrements from 5 to 4)
So, after the first iteration:

ini
Copy
Edit
output = [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]
count  = [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6]
Would you like me to walk through the next iterations step by step? ðŸ˜Š





You said:
yes go ahead and also small doubt how is exp knows it needs to take exp at 1st and 10 at 2nd places how?

Let's go step by step through the remaining iterations and also answer your doubt about how exp updates.

Understanding exp (Exponent) in Radix Sort
In Radix Sort, exp is responsible for determining the digit place we are currently sorting.

From this line in radixSort():

java
Copy
Edit
for (int exp = 1; max / exp > 0; exp *= 10)
First iteration: exp = 1 â†’ Sort by 1s place (digit % 10)
Second iteration: exp = 10 â†’ Sort by 10s place ((digit / 10) % 10)
Third iteration: exp = 100 â†’ Sort by 100s place ((digit / 100) % 10)
Why does this work?
exp starts at 1, so (number / 1) % 10 gives 1s place.
exp then becomes 10, so (number / 10) % 10 gives 10s place.
exp becomes 100, so (number / 100) % 10 gives 100s place.
This continues until the largest number in the array has no more digits left (max / exp > 0).
Step-by-Step Execution for countSort1()
We are processing:

java
Copy
Edit
arr = {29, 83, 471, 36, 91, 8}
with exp = 1 (sorting by 1s place).

Step 1: Compute the Digit at 1s Place
Copy
Edit
29  â†’ 9
83  â†’ 3
471 â†’ 1
36  â†’ 6
91  â†’ 1
8   â†’ 8
Step 2: Create the count Array
We count how many times each digit (0-9) appears.

less
Copy
Edit
Count array: [0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
1 appears twice (471, 91)
3 appears once (83)
6 appears once (36)
8 appears once (8)
9 appears once (29)
Step 3: Update count Array for Positioning
We compute cumulative sums:

less
Copy
Edit
Count (updated positions): [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
Now:

1s digit = 1 â†’ Numbers with 1 go until index 1
1s digit = 3 â†’ Numbers with 3 go at index 2
1s digit = 6 â†’ Numbers with 6 go at index 3
1s digit = 8 â†’ Numbers with 8 go at index 4
1s digit = 9 â†’ Numbers with 9 go at index 5
Step 4: Construct Output Array (Right to Left Processing)
First Iteration (i = 5, arr[5] = 8)
java
Copy
Edit
output[count[(arr[5] / 1) % 10] - 1] = arr[5];
count[(arr[5] / 1) % 10]--;
Extract digit: (8 / 1) % 10 = 8
Find position
